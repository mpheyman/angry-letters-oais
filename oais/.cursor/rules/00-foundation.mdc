Follow `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` first, then `project-documentation/INDEX.md` for deeper runbooks.

**Project non-negotiables (customize for your repo)**
- Security/privacy first; never add or paste real secrets.
- Add your stack and product constraints here (e.g. strict CSP, Docker-first, Postgres-first, brand/UX alignment).
- Point to your canonical vision/design doc and frontend guidelines if you have them.
