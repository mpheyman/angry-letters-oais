Align with `project-documentation/core/development-standards.md`.

**Backend conventions**
- Keep route handlers small; push shared logic into `utils/` where appropriate.
- Prefer early returns; keep error handling consistent.
- Preserve auth boundaries; use tokens or HMAC for protected resources as appropriate.
- Rate limit sensitive endpoints.
- Do not log sensitive user inputs or PII.
