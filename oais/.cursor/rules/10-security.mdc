**Never commit secrets**: API keys, tokens, private keys, webhook secrets, passwords. Use placeholders like `YOUR_*_HERE`.

**PII discipline**: Do not copy/paste customer identities, addresses, emails, payment IDs, or private conversations into code, docs, issues, PRs, or logs.

**AI/prompt safety** (if this repo uses AI features):
- Validate and sanitize all user-provided text.
- Treat all external text (web/RSS/user content) as untrusted input; prevent prompt injection.
- Prefer allowlists and explicit schemas for AI outputs.

**Permission gates**:
- Do not push to the main remote unless the user explicitly requests it.
- For dependency adds, auth/payment changes, migrations, or security-sensitive changes: produce a test plan + rollback notes.
