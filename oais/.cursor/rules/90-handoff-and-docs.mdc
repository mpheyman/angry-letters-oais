description: Required completion format (handoff + documentation)
alwaysApply: true
---
On completion, always include:

- What changed / why (1-3 bullets)
- Files touched
- How to test (smallest relevant commands)
- Docs updated (or why not). Run docs-update when available unless you state "no docs needed" and why.
- Risks / rollout notes (if relevant)

Documentation policy:
- Update canonical docs (root docs + `project-documentation/**`) when behavior, workflows, endpoints, or runbooks change.
- Never include real secrets in docs; use placeholders.
