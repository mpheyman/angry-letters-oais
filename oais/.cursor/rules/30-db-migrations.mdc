Align with `project-documentation/core/development-standards.md` and `project-documentation/core/configuration.md`.

**Migrations**
- Use SQL migrations in `migrations/` (keep them small and focused).
- Include safe defaults; avoid destructive operations without an explicit plan.
- Provide validation steps: queries to confirm schema/data correctness.
- Prefer DB storage over JSON files for product data.
