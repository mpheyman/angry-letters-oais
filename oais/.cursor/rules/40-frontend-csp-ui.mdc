Align with `project-documentation/core/frontend-guidelines.md` and `README.md` when present.

**Frontend rules**
- No inline scripts/styles (CSP).
- Prefer semantic HTML and theme-driven CSS; scope layout/theme at body or root.
- Use shared components and consistent CTA/link variants as defined in your project.
- Mobile-first: define breakpoints and test narrow viewports for no horizontal scroll.
