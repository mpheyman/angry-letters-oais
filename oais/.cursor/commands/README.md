# Slash commands

Add slash-command definitions here (e.g. `linear.md`, `project-breakdown.md`, `docs-update.md`). Each file typically describes one command: what it does, when to use it, and any parameters.

Examples you can add:

- Issue tracker: fetch issue, create issue, refine issue.
- Project planning: breakdown, build plan, project sync, status.
- Docs: docs-update, handoff.
- Safety: security-review, frontend CSP check.
- Backend: db-change, db-migration.

Use the same command names and structure as in repos that use this OAIS; customize for your tooling (e.g. replace Linear with Jira/GitHub Issues).
