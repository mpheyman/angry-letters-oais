# Agents

Add agent role definitions here (e.g. `planner.md`, `implementer.md`, `qa-runner.md`, `security-reviewer.md`, `docs-writer.md`). Each file describes one role: purpose, when to use it, and any constraints.

Customize roles for your workflow. Keep definitions short and link to project-documentation where needed.
